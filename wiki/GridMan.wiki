== What's here? ==
  * Coherence Security Code 
     * ( Kerberos / Active Directory integration )

     * Read / Write access to Caches and Invocation Services
     * A demo of the functionality
     * Coherence Security Utils
     * Tests for Security functionality
  * Kerberos GSS JAAS code to support the above (could be useful to others)

  * A simple driver for Coherence ( for running performance tests )
  * Andrew's presentation to the London Oracle Coherence SIG : [http://gridman.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sandbox/src/test/resources/SIGSecurity.ppt here]

== What's coming soon ==
  * BinaryDatabaseCacheStore - a CacheStore which writes the binary directly to the database
