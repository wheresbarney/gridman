=Welcome to Gridman=

This is an Oracle Coherence Open Source project, all the founders are Coherence Experts working in the London Financial Industry.

One of the main aims of this project is to submit code to the Coherence team in order to improve the core product.  Compare this with the [http://coherence.oracle.com/display/INCUBATOR/Home INCUBATOR] which is written by Oracle.

== What's here? ==
  * Coherence Security Code 
     * ( Kerberos / Active Directory integration ) [http://code.google.com/p/gridman/source/browse/#svn/trunk/sandbox/src/main/java/org/gridman/coherence/security/kerberos here]
     * Cluster lock ( a simple lock to the cluster with a System Property ) [http://code.google.com/p/gridman/source/browse/#svn/trunk/sandbox/src/main/java/org/gridman/coherence/security/clusterLock here]
     * Read / Write access to Caches and Invocation Services [http://code.google.com/p/gridman/source/browse/#svn/trunk/sandbox/src/main/java/org/gridman/coherence/security/simple here]
     * A demo of the functionality [http://code.google.com/p/gridman/source/browse/#svn/trunk/sandbox/src/main/java/org/gridman/coherence/security/demo here]
     * Coherence Security Utils [http://code.google.com/p/gridman/source/browse/trunk/sandbox/src/main/java/org/gridman/coherence/security/simple/CoherenceSecurityUtils.java here]
     * Tests for Security functionality [http://code.google.com/p/gridman/source/browse/trunk/sandbox/src/test/java/org/gridman/coherence/security/simple/SecurityTest.java here]
  * Kerberos GSS JAAS code to support the above (could be useful to others) [http://code.google.com/p/gridman/source/browse/trunk/sandbox/src/#src/main/java/org/gridman/kerberos here]
  * Classloader Cluster - startup a cluster in a single process using ChildFirstClassloaders for isolation [http://code.google.com/p/gridman/source/browse/#svn/trunk/sandbox/src/main/java/org/gridman/classloader here]
  * Andrew's presentation to the London Oracle Coherence SIG : [http://gridman.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sandbox/docs/SIGSecurity.ppt here]

== What's coming soon ==
  * BinaryDatabaseCacheStore - a CacheStore which writes the binary directly to the database
  * Index code ( useful classes for checking indexes ) 
  * SerializerChecker - to check you are not deserializing certain objects on the cluster
