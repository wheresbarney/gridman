#summary Coherence Security


== Relevant classes ==
All of these hooks can be used for audit as well as security

|| Name || Description || Example || Signature ||
|| IdentityTransformer || Client transforms the Subject -> Token (may be null) || Kerberos || Object transformIdentity(Subject subject) ||
|| IdentityAsserter || Proxy transforms the Token -> Subject (may be null) || Kerberos || Subject assertIdentity(Object oToken) ||
|| CacheServiceProxy || Intercepts cache requests || Use Gridmans! || NamedCache ensureCache(String cache, ClassLoader classLoader) || 
|| InvokeServiceProxy || Intercepts invoke requests || Use Gridmans! || execute + query methods ||


Gridman provides the following :

|| CacheSecurityProvider || Subject, CacheName, Readonly || Use a cache or AD Groups ||
|| InvokeSecurityProvider || Subject, Invocable || Use a cache or AD Groups ||
|| PermissionedNamedCache || Wrapper named cache to provide read/write functionality || Could extend to provide object level security * ||

=== Object level security ===
This could be provided using a WrapperCache.  However, remember Coherence is a *high performance* product so you better make sure this is a fast call!
